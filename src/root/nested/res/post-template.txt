It's the magical, once-in-a-century time for ents living in {tzDesc}. Toke up, savor the moment, and throw a comment in here (or make a post of your own with the "Synchronized Tokes" flair) to celebrate!

We want to celebrate today by filling the subreddit with fun things to do to commerate the day. We've put a few things into this post, but we want you to do your part and post your favorite things to do and watch while high &ndash; Youtube content, websites, whatever &ndash; until the subreddit is completely taken over by 420-octane stoner fuel. If it fits in this post, make a comment on this post and let us know, and we'll add it to the hourly post!

The pandemic might have put a damper on everyone's plans for today, but we've got a full day's worth of ent-ertainment for you. Relax, get comfortable, and enjoy the day with the finest selection of stoner links and streams that the internet has to offer!
